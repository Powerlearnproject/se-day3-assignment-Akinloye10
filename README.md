Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering applies engineering principles, methods,and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.

 Software engineering plays an important role in the technology industry by enabling  the  creation of software applications useful in modern life(communication,commerce,entertainment and healthcare)


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages ,establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's ,the rise of agile methologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements
2.design
3.implementation
4.testing
5.deployment
6.maintenance

1.requirements:gethering and documenting the user's need and system requirement
2.design:creating an high level design structure and user's interface
3.implementation:writing code and building software according to design specifications
4.testing:conducting several tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements
5.deployment:releasing the software to users
6.maintenance:providing ongoing support,updates,and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall:sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downward like a waterfall
Agile:iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration, and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer:responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assuarance Engineer:ensures the software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager:oversees the planning , execution and delivery of software products 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE:provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging, and testing codes

VCS:for tracking changes to source code and cordinating work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements-recap of key points
Tight deadlines-improvement of learning environment
Technical debt-encouragement for further learning

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: testing individual components or modules of software
Integration Testing:testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System Testing:testing the software system as a whole 
Acceptance Testing:testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user  needs 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
for example, if you want to create a prompt explaining software engineering to a 6 year old but if one  writes this instead:
explain software engineering.
for this prompt,the AI would respond by explaining software engineering but it wouldn't give a detailed explaination of software enginnering to a 6 year old but if one improve it by making it clear and specific by writing this:
explain software engineering to a 6 year old.
For this prompt, the AI would respond by giving a well detailed response .# se-day3-assignment-Akinloye10
